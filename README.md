# Client
The Task-FE includes the angular app without the modules, so you will need to first install those using NPM install.
* The API ip can be changed from 'tasks.service.ts' under src/app.

# API
I used flask REST API with mongoDb, so in order to run it you will need to run pip install for 3 modules:
pymongo, flask, flask-cors.

* The mongoDb ip/port can be changed from the top of script.
